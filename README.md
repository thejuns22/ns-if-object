# ns-if-object

Hi, i wish to present my script for the NetSuite Developer Assesment test.

I used Visual Studio Code for testing and importing the order.json file.

For the script to run i included a require to run and get the order.json. 

I also added a codepen to run the script but had to copy paste the object and declare a variable for it.
