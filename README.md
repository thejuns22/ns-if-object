# ns-if-object

Hi, i wish to present my script for the NetSuite Developer Assesment test.

I used Visual Studio Code for testing and importing the order.json file.

For the script to run i included a require to run and get the order.json. 

I also created a snippet from codepen to run the script online but had to copy paste the object and declare a variable for it.

To check the final results a console.log will show the object with the update line_items
